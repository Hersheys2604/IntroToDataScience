# Intro To DataScience
All my work from Introduction to Data Science. Covered the basics of Data Science including:
   - Data: collection and sampling, data quality.
   - Analytic tasks: statistical hypothesis testing, exploratory and confirmatory analysis.
   - Probability distributions: dependence and independence, multivariate Gaussian, Poisson, Dirichlet, random number generation and simulation of distributions, simulation of samples (bootstrap).
   - Predictive models: linear and logistic regression, and Bayesian classification.
   - Estimation: parameter and function estimation, maximum likelihood and minimum cost estimators, Monte Carlo estimators, inverse probabilities and Bayes theorem, bias versus variance and sample size effects, cross- 
     validation, estimation of model performance.
